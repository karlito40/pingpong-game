Youssy Ball is a mobile game base on the awesome [galshir](https://dribbble.com/galshir) ideas. Yet this is a prototype. The code was not mean to be seen as it was built really late on a train. But eh, who care.

## Technos

* [PhysicsJS](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/) Just leave the one provide on this project as it has been modified to make it works the way i want. Well this one also fixed the pixi v3 rendering.
* [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)

## Todo

1. Rewrite everything properly.
