**Youssy Ball** is a mobile game base on the awesome [galshir](https://dribbble.com/galshir) ideas. Yet this is a prototype for my current employer. The code was not mean to be seen as it was built really late on a train. But eh, who care ! I had fun making and playing it.

## Technos

* [PhysicsJS](http://wellcaffeinated.net/PhysicsJS/) Just leave the one provide on this project. It has been modified to make it works the way i want. Well my version also add some feature to the pixi rendering and fixe some of his bug.

* [PixiJS](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)
* [GsapJS](http://greensock.com/gsap)

## Todo

1. Rewrite everything properly (maybe typescript ?).
2. Codepen.
2. Pull request PhysicsJS.
2. Replace Gsap for Velocity (gsap needs a licence).

## Scores

Me - 13 255m ;)
